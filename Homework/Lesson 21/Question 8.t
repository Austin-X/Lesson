%This is Question 8 : Julia has $300 in her bank account earning 1.25% interest while Max has only $280 but he earns 2% interest.  How many years before Max has more money in his account than Julia?

put "I used the Equation : 300 + 1.25x = 280 + 2x"
put "The answer was 26.6 infinite, so I rounded up to 27 years."
put "In 27 years, Max will have more money than Julia."

%I know you're supposed to create a program to calculate it but I was too LAZY!
