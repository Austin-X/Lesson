%This is Question 3 : Write a program that takes a whole number as input from the user and outputs all the factors of that number.  (Hint: to check whether a number is a factor use mod to check whether the remainder equals zero.  You need to check every number from 1 to the user input to see if it is a factor.)

get whole

for decreasing i : whole .. 1
